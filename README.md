# Daily reminder

---

## Introduction

Lots of daily stuff to do. Taking supplement pills, checking website updates ... etc.
Sometimes can't remember if already took pill today. So I develop this small tool.


## How to Use

PHP [https://fatfreeframework.com](Fat-Free) Framework is used. After installing the framework with one simple command, do the following:
1. Create 'tmp' folder, chmod to writable
2. Create 'data' folder, chmod to writable
3. [https://fatfreeframework.com/3.8/routing-engine#DynamicWebSites](Setup your web server) (Apache/Nginx). I use Apache. That means I need to enable RewriteEngine and create .htaccess
